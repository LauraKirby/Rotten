What took so long? 
I spent an hour trying to figure out the Cocoapods install. Tim and Nathan helped me out Sunday night (thank you!). Problem - gems weren't installing. Source of problem - version of Ruby. Solution - if running stock Ruby (meaning, version macbook comes with), then install "sudo gem install cocoapods." If running "rvm," (maybe bc you attended a RailsBridge or bc your super advanced) then install "gem install cocoapods". 

Another issue, the .gitignore step was unclear. Acutally, I had no idea how to approach this until my software developer friend explained it to me. Easy concept but Google wasn't returning a ton of results.

Something that just added time, I worked through the video with my friend who explained the advanced concepts to me. 

I hope to go back and add some of the visual effects.
