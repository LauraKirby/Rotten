Issues:
Installing Cocoapods. Problem - gems weren't installing. Source of problem - Ruby. Solution - if running stock Ruby (meaning, version macbook comes with), then install "sudo gem install cocoapods." If running "rvm," then install using "gem install cocoapods". 

Issue with the .gitignore. Easy concept but Google wasn't returning a ton of results.
