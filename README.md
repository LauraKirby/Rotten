What took so long? 
I spent an hour trying to figure out the Cocoapods install. Problem - gems weren't installing. Source of problem - version of Ruby. Solution - if running stock Ruby (meaning, version macbook comes with), then install "sudo gem install cocoapods." If running "rvm," then install "gem install cocoapods". 

Issue with the .gitignore. Easy concept but Google wasn't returning a ton of results. A software developer friend helped me here.
